I have downloaded the screen scraping program; HtmlUnit on my iMac. I went on StackOverflow to learn what to put into the HtmlUnit program. I have also begun downloading NetBeans for my iMac via the tutorial they have on their website. The first screenscrapings will begin next week and I will hopefully be able to have the code for (at least) several SCP files. This progress will help me in creating the program and I am beginning to think that I could add more features of the program. Perhaps a website would be useful for distributing the information to people on the internet. I will also have to consider the aesthetics of the website; I already have some design ideas on paper for the website’s physical appearance. I also have some design ideas for what the GUI will look like. Perhaps I will be able to make a search bar so the user can search for specific files (I still need to research how to do this, but I definitely think that a search feature would be nice).

I have added additional code to the HtmlUnit and I have begun working on the NetBeans coding. I will probably use Weebly to make my website for the program. Unfortunately I have been set back a bit because my flash drive was corrupted and I had to format it. Despite this, I will definitely be able to get some work done and scrape more files. Also, I have decided to move all of my 20% Project work to a Windows computer, since the Mac OS X is a little bit less friendly to the necessary programs. All of my stuff is now on the windows computer and hopefully there will be less problems regarding compatibility. I have envisioned the GUI having the following: a working search box, anywhere from 200-500 separate SCP files, and a README.txt file that will explain the SCP foundation, classifications, and the actual website. The README.txt will be written to tell the user how to use the program.

I have created the website via the Weebly website creator, complete with links and information about the whole concept behind the program. I used a cool aesthetic, visual theme that matches the classified, official motif of the SCP Foundation. The website features three separate sections: home, about, and contact (home is the place where the download file will be). The website URL is http://scpfile.weebly.com/. I do realize that it will not be until the end of the project that I will be able to actually have the program on the website, but I am sure that having the website now is better than having it later since it is a fairly easy thing to do. Another thing that I have done is explore the NetBeans Program. Unsurprisingly, the program itself has a fairly complex GUI and I am in the process of exploring all of its features and understanding how it works. I have some pretty great ideas for the program’s GUI.
