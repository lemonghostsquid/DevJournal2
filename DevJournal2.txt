I have downloaded the screen scraping program; HtmlUnit on my iMac. I went on StackOverflow to learn how to properly use the HtmlUnit program. I have also begun downloading NetBeans for my iMac via the tutorial they have on their website. The first screenscrapings will begin next week and I will hopefully be able to have the code for (at least) several SCP files. This progress will help me in creating the program and I am beginning to think that I could add more features of the program. Perhaps a website would be useful for distributing the information to people on the internet. I will also have to consider the aesthetics of the website; I already have some design ideas on paper for the website’s physical appearance. I also have some design ideas for what the GUI will look like. Perhaps I will be able to make a search bar so the user can search for specific files (I still need to research how to do this, but I definitely think that a search feature would be nice).
